# Key datasets for analysing young people and education 


## What do we mean by 'data' (1)

- Individual vs aggregated
- Nature of data: survey vs other source: devices, administrative records, etc.
- *About* organisations (ie schools) vs people
- *From* organisations and young people 
- One off studies vs series
- Photography (ie cross-sectional) vs video (longitudinal)
- Our focus today: **individual survey microdata**


## What do we mean by 'data' (2)

- Questions asked to people 

  - About objective characteristics ie height, weight, age
  - About views and attitude:
  
    - Attitudes and opinions on crime, gender change
    - Validated instruments (ie mental health)
- External measurement (biosample, genetic, cortisol levels)
- Smart data (from devices ex accelerometer, energy meter)
- Linked administrative records - more on this later

## Education-related questions
- Qualifications (academic/vocational): 
  - Type; level; grade, subject
- Current education: 
  - where studying; year; school moves; whether fees-paying
  - qualifications studying for: type; number; subjects
- Are  studies/training choices  informed by job wishes to do
- From whom obtained post-16 educational advice
- Drawn from the Millenium Cohort Study

# Major studies

## At a glance ...

- (Birth) cohort studies
- Understanding Society
- Census
- Linked data
- A few repeated cross-sectional studies


## Birth cohort studies
- Follow a sample of individuals from birth until death
- People born during during the same  specific period of time in 1958(NCDS), 1970(BCS), 2000 (MCS), 2026 (Generation New Area)
- Wide range of measurements, including education and health
- Within and between cohort analysis
- Managed by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (UCL)

## The Cohort Studies at the CLS
![](pics/cohort_studies.png){fig-alt="Screenshot from Cohort page on the Center for Longitudinal Studies website" fig-align="center" width=50%}

## Millennium Cohort Study (MCS)
  
  - ~ 19K children (born between June 2001 and Jan 2003)
  - 8 *sweeps*: age 9 months then 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, 17, 23
  - Parent and child interviews
  - Education, skills, health, truancy, cognitive ability...
  - Biological measurements 
  - ... Socio-economic and demographic  characteristics
- Data available at the UK Data Service [here](https://datacatalogue.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/series/2000031#abstract)




## Example: Kandola et al (2022)

- Screen-based sedentary behaviour and depression

  - Is a sedentary lifestyle alongside  screen and device usage,  associated with depression?
  - Does physical activity make a difference?

- 11,341 teenagers from the Millennium Cohort Study 
- The main outcome was depressive symptoms at age 14
  - A measured by the Moods and Feelings questionnaire
  
- Against frequency of video game, social media, and internet use (age 11).
- Impact of self-reported physical activity

## Results

![](pics/mcs_sedentary.png){fig-alt="Screenshot from Table 2 from Kandola et al (2022) " fig-align="center" width=90%}

- IRR: likelihood of depression ($<1=$less likely, $>1=$more likely) 

## Conclusions

- More frequent  gaming at age 11  associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms at age 14 for boys but not girls. 
- More frequent social media use at 11  associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms in  girls but not boys. 
- More frequent video game use was consistently associated with fewer depressive symptoms for  boys with low physical activity, but not  those with high physical activity

## Young people and mental health (1)
*Parra-Mujica, Johnson et al (2023)*

- Positive association between health for the  16 to 24 and:  

  - differences in household income
  - short-term income changes are significant, 

- Microsimulation shows that respondents on lower income would benefit the most from increases in their  income, 
- Focusing on the poorest risks neglecting other vulnerable subgroups, ie  young workers and single youth

## Young people and mental health (2)

# How to access the data

## Levels of access{.smaller}
![](pics/levels.png){fig-alt="A slide showwing the four levels of data access at the UK Data Service" width=80%} 

- The lesser the conditions for accesssing the data, the fewer the details included
- Open data includes fewer personal information; controlled data significantly more
- Safeguarded data strikes a compromise between accessibility and level of detail
<!-- ## Creating a project and downloading the data -->

<!-- ## Secure datasets at the UK Data Service -->

<!-- -   UKDS Secure Lab -->

- *Controlled data:*

  - Register
  - Provide a detailed description of your project
